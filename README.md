Hi my handle is @xXsma11poXx
I'm a current engineering student who is interested in cyber security, data structures, machine learning, web dev, and AI
I'm currently learning python and plan on learning C++, Java, or Javascript
I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything.  I am here to learn and help other learn.
How to reach me ...<still figuring that out>
